# Product Requirements Document (PRD): Project Aether

## 🎯 Strategic Goal
Build a "Digital Synesthesia" engine targeting acquisition by LVMH's Perfumes & Cosmetics Division (Target Date: Q3 2027).
**Valuation Thesis:** Capture "Pre-Purchase Psychographic Intent" data to bridge the "Digital Sensory Gap"[cite: 72, 77].

## 👤 Target Audience
- **Primary:** Gen Z and Gen Alpha consumers who view fragrance as aesthetic identity ("Scent-Sona") rather than a commodity[cite: 74].
- **Psychographics:** Users seeking "Empathetic AI" over "Utility AI" (e.g., mapping "heartbroken vampire" to a scent)[cite: 81].

## 🛠 Core Features (MVP)

### 1. The "Scent-Sona" Engine (Vector Search)
- **Input:** User uploads visual cues (outfit photo) or auditory cues (Spotify link)[cite: 91].
- **Process:** AI analyzes aesthetic "vibe" -> Maps to 768-dimensional "Scent Space" using Vertex AI -> Finds nearest neighbor scent clusters[cite: 90].
- **Output:** 3 curated recommendations with "Why" reasoning based on cultural translation (e.g., "Golden Hour" = Bergamot)[cite: 19].

### 2. Generative UI (Digital Synesthesia)
- **Requirement:** The UI must *visually* translate the scent profile[cite: 37].
- **Behavior:**
    - "Aquatic/Marine" → Background shifts to Deep Teals; Buttons become "floaty"[cite: 97].
    - "Oud/Leather" → Background shifts to Dark Amber; Interactions become "heavy"[cite: 98].
- **Tech constraint:** Must use `flutter_animate` and dynamic theming for 60fps performance[cite: 96].

### 3. "Blind Date" Discovery Mode
- **Logic:** Hide brand metadata (Bottle/Name) during discovery to remove brand bias[cite: 102].
- **Reveal:** User scans a QR code or achieves "Emotional Bond" score to reveal the product[cite: 112].

## 📊 Success Metrics
- **Predictive Accuracy:** 85% accuracy in anticipating consumer response[cite: 18].
- **Retention:** "Consultant-nature" driving high retention (target 65%)[cite: 56, 57].
- **Data Moat:** Collection of "Synesthetic Data Points" (linking color/sound to scent) for R&D syndication[cite: 51].
